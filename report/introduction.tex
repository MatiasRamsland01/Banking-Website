The goal of the project was to create a secure banking application, resistant to OWASP TOP10 attacks.

Our application allows users to add money to their account,  send it to a different user through a webpage. Visitors cannot use banking services. To become a user, a visitor must sign up for an account first.

The application is written in python with flask framework, and is using SQLAlchemy with Heroku addon resource Heroku-Postgresql as our database where we store our information.
